Since the beginning of the pandemic, MIU clubs are facing many challenges as all kinds of curricu-
lar activities have been massively affected. The lack of communication between students and clubs
has become a real concern. The proposed solution will help the clubs reach the maximum number
of interested students. Every registered club will have its profile with the ability to post all related
information and updates about its activities and events on regular basis. Clubs can start recruiting
process through the application and interested students can apply. Students can also provide their
feedback about the club to inspire new members to join.
